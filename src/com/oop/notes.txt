Object Oriented Programming
---------------------------
1. Java is a class based language
2. Java class consist 5 elements .
      1. Variables
      2. Methods
      3. constructors
      4. Blocks
      5. Inner Class (Nested Class)

 Example :

class <class name >
{
  1. Variables
      2. Methods
      3. constructors
      4. Blocks
      5. Inner Class (Nested Class)

  }

  3. Variables
  a. Variables are used to store data/ value

   Example :
        int rollno = 101:
        Where "rollno " is variables that store 101 (data / value constant)

   b. There are 3 types of Variables in java.
        * local Variables
              |- lv are define inside the Method / constructor/ block.
              |- Calling of lv depend on :Method / constructor/ block.
              |- Memory Allocation : Stack


        * Instant   variables
             |- IV are define inside the class but outside the Method / constructor/ block.
             |- Calling of lv depend on : object
             |- Memory Allocation : Heap
             |- How many times Memory will create :depend upon on. of object, if we have
                  3  object of a class then 3 time memory will be create for single TV


        * Static Variable
             |-   SV are define inside the class but outside the Method / constructor/ block.
             |- Calling of lv depend on : class
             |- Memory Allocation : Non-Heap
             |- How many times Memory will create : one time.

     Example :
           Program1.java

     4. Methods
