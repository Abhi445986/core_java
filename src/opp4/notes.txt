Abstraction
===========
1. It is a process in which hiding implementation details and showing only functionality to the user.
2. Abstraction can be achieved by
      |- Abstract class.
      |- Interfaces.

Abstract class
==============
1. If we assign ' abstract' keyworld of the class then we can say that class is an abstract
2. Abstract class consist Abstract  method and non-abstract method
    abstract class.
             abstract void show();

      non-abstract method
           void show ()
           {
           // statement

         }

 3. If we declare a class ' abstract' than it is compulsory to create child class of that  abstract
 4. Child class is

 Interfaces
 ==========
 1. It is used to achieve abstrection.
 2. It is also used to achieve Multiple Inheritance.
 3. by using achieve program become loosely coupled.
 4. Syntax:

          Interfaces < Interfaces-name>
          {
              // elements
          }

5. Relation b/w  class and  Interfaces
6.  Internal details of interfaces.
